# Week 1 Day 1: Attention and Multi-Head Attention

<div class="warning">

This book is not complete and this chapter is not finalized yet. We are still working on the reference solution, writing
tests, and unify the math notations in the book.

</div>

In day 1, we will implement the basic attention layer and the multi-head attention layer. Attention layers take a input
sequence and focus on different parts of the sequence when generating the output. Attention layers are the key building
blocks of the Transformer models.

[ðŸ“š Reading: Transformer Architecture](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/6)

We use the Qwen2 model for text generation. The model is a decoder-only model. The input of the model is a sequence of
token embeddings. The output of the model is the most likely next token ID.

Back to the attention layer. The attention layer takes a query, a key, and a value. In a classic implementation, all
of them are of the same shape: `N.. x L x D`.

`N..` is zero or some number of dimensions for batches. Within each of the batch, `L` is the sequence length and `D` is
the dimension of the embedding for a given head in the sequence.

So, for example, if we have a sequence of 1024 tokens, where each of the token has a 512-dimensional embedding (head_dim),
we will pass a tensor of the shape `N.. x 1024 x 512` to the attention layer.

## Task 1: Implement `scaled_dot_product_attention`

In this task, we will implement the scaled dot product attention function.

```
pdm run test -k week_1_day_1_task_1 -v
```

TODO: fix test case names, do not do same dims in this chapter: instead, introduce S, L, H, D, etc.

Implement `scaled_dot_product_attention` following the below attention function. The function takes key, value, and query of the same dimensions, and an optional mask matrix `M`.

$$
  \text{Attention} = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} + M)V
$$

```
L is seq_len, in PyTorch API it's S (source len)
D is head_dim

key: N.. x L x D
value: N.. x L x D
query: N.. x L x D
output: N.. x L x D
```

You may use `softmax` provided by mlx and implement it later in week 2.

Because we are always using the attention layer within the multi-head attention layer, the actual tensor shape when serving
the model will be:

```
key: 1 x H x L x D
value: 1 x H x L x D
query: 1 x H x L x D
output: 1 x H x L x D
mask: 1 x H x L x L
```

.. though the attention layer only cares about the last two dimensions. The test case will test any shape of the batching dimension.

At the end of this task, you should be able to pass the following tests:

```
pdm run test -k test_attention_simple
pdm run test -k test_attention_with_mask
```

## Task 2: Implement `MultiHeadAttention`

In this task, we will implement the multi-head attention layer.

Implement `MultiHeadAttention`. The layer takes a batch of vectors, maps it through the K, V, Q weight matrixes, and use the attention function we implemented in task 1 to compute the result. The output needs to be mapped using the O
weight matrix.

You will also need to implement the `linear` function in `basics.py` first. For `linear`, it takes a tensor of the shape `N.. x I`, a weight matrix of the shape `O x I`, and a bias vector of the shape `O`. The output is of the shape `N.. x O`. `I` is the input dimension and `O` is the output dimension.

For the `MultiHeadAttention` layer, the input tensors `query`, `key`, `value` have the shape `N x L x E`, where `E` is the dimension of the
embedding for a given token in the sequence. The `K/Q/V` weight matrixes will map the tensor into key, value, and query
separately, where the dimension `E` will be mapped into a dimension of size `H x D`, which means that the token embedding
gets mapped into `H` heads, each with a dimension of `D`. You can directly reshape the tensor to split the `H x D` dimension
into two dimensions of `H` and `D` to get `H` heads for the token.

Now, you have a tensor of the shape `N.. x L x H x D` for each of the key, value, and query. To apply the attention function, you first need to transpose them into shape `N.. x H x L x D`.

* This makes each attention head an independent batch, so that attention can be calculated separately for each head across the sequence `L`.
* If you kept `H` behind `L`, attention calculation would mix head and sequence dimensions, which is not what we want â€” each head should focus only on the relationships between tokens in its own subspace.

The attention function produces output for each of the head of the token. Then, you can transpose it back into `N.. x L x H x D` and reshape it
so that all heads get merged back together with a shape of `N.. x L x (H x D)`. Map it through the output weight matrix to get
the final output.

```
E is hidden_size or embed_dim or dims or model_dim
H is num_heads
D is head_dim
L is seq_len, in PyTorch API it's S (source len)

w_q/w_k/w_v: E x (H x D)
output/input: N x L x E
w_o: (H x D) x E
```

At the end of the day, you should be able to pass the following tests:

```
pdm run test -k week_1_day_1_task_2 -v
```
